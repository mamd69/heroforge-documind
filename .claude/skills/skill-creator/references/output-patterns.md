# Output Patterns

This reference covers patterns for ensuring consistent, high-quality output from skills.

## Template Pattern

Use templates when you need Claude to produce output in a specific format.

### Rigid Templates

For outputs that must follow an exact structure (like API responses or formal documents):

```markdown
## Output Format

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

\`\`\`
[HEADER]
Title: {title}
Date: {date}
Author: {author}

[BODY]
{content}

[FOOTER]
Generated by: {system_name}
\`\`\`
```

### Flexible Templates

For outputs where some variation is acceptable:

```markdown
## Output Format

Use this as a sensible default format, but use your best judgment to adapt based on context:

\`\`\`
# {title}

## Summary
{brief_summary}

## Details
{detailed_content}

## Next Steps
{recommendations}
\`\`\`

Adapt the structure if the content requires different sections or the user requests a different format.
```

## Examples Pattern

Use concrete input/output examples to demonstrate desired output style and quality.

### Why Examples Work

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone. They're particularly valuable when:

- Output quality depends on subtle stylistic choices
- The format has nuanced requirements
- Multiple valid approaches exist but one is preferred

### Example: Commit Messages

```markdown
## Commit Message Format

Follow this format for commit messages:

### Example 1
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
\`\`\`
feat(auth): add JWT-based user authentication

Implement secure authentication flow using JSON Web Tokens.
Includes token generation, validation, and refresh logic.
\`\`\`

### Example 2
Input: Fixed bug where users couldn't reset passwords
Output:
\`\`\`
fix(auth): resolve password reset flow failure

The reset token validation was incorrectly checking expiration
timestamps in local time instead of UTC.
\`\`\`
```

## Combining Patterns

For best results, combine templates with examples:

```markdown
## Report Format

Use this template:
\`\`\`
# {title}

## Executive Summary
{1-2 paragraph summary}

## Findings
{detailed findings}

## Recommendations
{actionable recommendations}
\`\`\`

### Example Report

# Q4 Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary
The Q4 results exceeded targets by 15%, driven primarily by
the new product launch in October...

## Findings
1. Revenue increased 23% YoY
2. Customer acquisition cost decreased by 8%
...
```

## Best Practices

1. **Match strictness to requirements** - Use rigid templates only when necessary
2. **Provide realistic examples** - Use examples that reflect actual use cases
3. **Show edge cases** - Include examples of tricky scenarios
4. **Keep examples concise** - Show just enough to convey the pattern
5. **Update based on feedback** - Refine examples when output quality issues arise
